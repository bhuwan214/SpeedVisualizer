# 🎬 Line Graph Slow Animation - Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

The line graph now displays internet speed changes with a **slow, progressive animation** that makes every fluctuation clearly visible.

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### Animation Speed
- **Before**: 400ms (too fast to see changes)
- **After**: 800-1200ms (2-3× slower, smooth and visible)

### Drawing Effect
- **Before**: All points appeared instantly
- **After**: Points appear sequentially with 30ms delay between each
- **Result**: Beautiful "wave" effect as the line draws from left to right

### Visual Enhancements
- ✅ **Thicker lines** (3px vs 2px) - easier to see
- ✅ **Larger points** (4px vs 3px) - more prominent
- ✅ **Smoother curves** (tension 0.4 vs 0.3) - more natural flow
- ✅ **Glow effects** - 10px blur with colored shadows
- ✅ **White point borders** - better contrast and visibility
- ✅ **Enhanced tooltips** - shows exact Mbps values

## 🎨 Animation Details

### Progressive Reveal
```
Time    Graph State
────────────────────────────────
0ms     ○○○○○○○○○○  (empty)
30ms    ●○○○○○○○○○  (point 1)
60ms    ●●○○○○○○○○  (point 2)
90ms    ●●●○○○○○○○  (point 3)
...     ...
1500ms  ●●●●●●●●●●  (complete)
```

### Easing Functions
- **Main animation**: `easeInOutQuart` - smooth start and end
- **X-axis (horizontal)**: `easeOutQuart` - slides in from left
- **Y-axis (vertical)**: `easeOutCubic` - grows from zero

### Stagger Effect
Each data point appears **30ms** after the previous one:
- 50 data points = ~1.5 seconds total animation
- Creates smooth "painting" effect
- Clearly shows speed changes as they happen

## 🎮 How It Works During Speed Test

### Download Phase (5 seconds)
```
0s    ─── Test starts, chart begins drawing
0.1s  ─── First speed measurement (point 1)
0.2s  ─── Second measurement (point 2)
0.3s  ─── Third measurement (point 3)
...   ─── 50+ measurements total
5.0s  ─── Download complete

Animation: Each new point slides in from left and grows from bottom
Duration: 800ms per animation cycle
Effect: Smooth, continuous line drawing
```

### Upload Phase (5 seconds)
Same progressive animation for upload line (blue)
